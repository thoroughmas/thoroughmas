Inspired by the power struggle that is talkback radio, I created this little spoof radio interview. "Outside The Underappreciated's Studio" is hosted by the unstoppable Bill Lipton, a radio personality who brings unappreciated community heroes onto his show in order to tear them apart.

I pulled this first episode together pretty quickly in order to see if the idea had any merit as a podcast-esque product. I'm currently undecided, but tentatively hopeful. I'll keep building my ideas for possible future episodes.

Listen to the first episode here:

Hopefully I'll have enough inspiration pulsing through my veins to follow this up with some more interviews by Bill Lipton in future weeks.

Yours psychotically,
