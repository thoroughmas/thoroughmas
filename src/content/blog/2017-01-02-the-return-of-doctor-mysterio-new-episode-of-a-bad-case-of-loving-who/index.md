It's been a whole year since I joined Chris to do an episode of our Doctor Who fan podcast, A Bad Case of Loving Who. Join us in this impromptu episode as we struggle to remember not only last year's Christmas Special, but also what even happened in this year's episode, The Return of Doctor Mysterio.

You can find the latest (and every) episode of our podcast <a href="http://thomasmidena.me/podcast/a-bad-case-of-loving-who">over here, on it's dedicated page</a>. And we'll be back in a few months to talk about Season 10! Hopefully slightly more prepared.
