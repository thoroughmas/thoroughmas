If you're a user of Google Music and Windows 7, you'll want to check out this [Google Music Desktop Player](http://vhanla.deviantart.com/art/Google-Music-Desktop-Player-253378729) that Victor Alberto Gil has designed.

I've messed around (played music) with it for a few days now, and here's some quick pros and cons I've come across:
### Pros:
- **Keyboard Controls**  
  If you have play/pause media control buttons on your keyboard, they'll now work with Google Music.
  
- **Notifications**  
  When a new song begins to play, a little notification appears.
  
- **Standalone**  
  Keep the music away from your browser. Your web browser is probably already full of dozens of tabs performing all kinds of everyday operations, what with email and social networking, so getting Google Music out into its own space is a good thing.
  
- **Last.FM Scrobbling**  
  Use Last.FM? No problem, it's built in.
  
- **Fast And Smooth**  
  The program launches quickly and plays songs fast, especially considering it's streaming.
  
- **Labs Features Work**  
  Want HTML5 or Star Ratings on your music? Turn them on in Google Music Labs, and they'll work seamlessly with the player.
### Cons:
- **No Search Box**  
  As far as I can see, there's no way to search through your music. It's a big thing, so hopefully it'll be added.
  
- **Last.FM Scrobbling Errors**  
  I have encountered a few little issues with the Last.FM Scrobbling. Mainly, it doesn't work great with playlists. It doesn't seem to recognise the change in artist throughout a playlist.
  
- **General Bugs**  
  It's to be expected with a little user-created program like this, but there are some general little bugs in regards to navigation and the interface. These have never affected me too much though, and hopefully improvements will be made in the future!
