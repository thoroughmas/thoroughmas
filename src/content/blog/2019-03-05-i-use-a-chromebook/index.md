And I've recently made a few YouTube videos about it. The first has received a lot of attention. As in, like 5 times more attention than my next most popular original YouTube video. This is nice, but unexpected, and low-key stressful and daunting. In general, I'm thankful that audiences have been lovely (YouTubers are often &amp; notoriously the worst). 

It is still interesting how easily online audiences can take everything as a personal affront. Sure I enjoy Chromebooks, but I genuinely like all kinds of computers, and don't care what other people want to use. In the end they're all just slightly different tools. Some viewers have taken my videos about Chromebooks as a statement that everyone should use Chromebooks. Outrage is the opium of the internet.

Anyhow, here are the three videos:
