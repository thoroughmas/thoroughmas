I'm always down for an ambitious podcast idea, so when my filmmaker friend Jacob Hazeldine agreed to spend five minutes each fortnight developing a feature film, we had to do it.

It is basically what it sounds like. Every fortnight we record a five minute episode, in which we talk about and develop the film we're going to make (starting from scratch). We cannot actively work on the film outside of those five minutes. And we've got to get the film done in five years, by 2023.

We've done a few episodes so far, and we stream live at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.spreaker.com/show/film">https://www.spreaker.com/show/film</a>. Check it out there, or below, or subscribe on your favourite podcast catcher.
