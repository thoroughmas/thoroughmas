Last week I started a brand new show on Swinburne's student radio station. Predictably, it's all about film soundtracks. Each week I'll be ranking my ten favourite film scores from each year, starting with the year 2002 and eventually reaching 2014.

As explained at the start of this episode, I had some audio issues and this recording doesn't sound as great as it will in future weeks.

[Spreaker Audio](//www.spreaker.com/embed/player/standard?autoplay=false&episode_id=4867461)

Every piece of music I played throughout this episode is available in full on [this Google Music playlist](https://play.google.com/music/playlist/AMaBXyng1aHaNgBg1bPzplVt8yfJs1RJGmaz8CqYGcrqyhSflCRqWojrFuE8pJkP74rY8l9j_7Y7R1JIBZDrouM1DROuqUKd-A==).

You can also see a list of each track after the bump:

*Bono - Children of the Revolution*

***10**. John Powell - Main Titles*
***9**. Pete Anthony - Main Titles*
***8**. Danny Elfman - Main Title*
***7**. John Williams - The Flash Comics Clue*
***6**. Patrick Doyle - Inspector Thompson*
***5**. Klaus Badelt - I Don't Belong Here*
***4**. John Williams - Across The Stars*
***3**. James Newton Howard - The Hand of Fate - Part I*
***2**. Howard Shore - The Riders of Rohan*
***1**. John Williams - Fawkes The Phoenix*

*Stan Getz - The Girl From Impanema*

Hope you'll join me in future weeks. You can listen live on Wednesdays [at 3SSR.org](http://3ssr.org/show/scores-of-scores/), but I'll also post each future episode here on my blog for you.

Yours lethargically,
