Trials of the Trimillenium is my new fictional podcast, featuring sci-fi stories told in the style of This American Life. I just finished the first episode, about a robot with a bad sense of humour. I do pretty much all the voices in this one, but just like with <a href="http://www.spreaker.com/show/outside-the-underappreciateds-studio_1"><span id="goog_1692846507"></span>my other fictional podcast<span id="goog_1692846508"></span></a>, I plan to do that less in future.

Have a listen here:

The date is November 3, 3024. Dr Deckar has created a robot. Her life will never be the same again.

This episode comes with special thanks to Saurav Kundu and Jarrah Fowler.
