A few weeks ago it was a delight to be a part of Corrugated Iron's little production of the short comedy play, Courting 101, in Malak's Chambers Crescent Theatre. I played a crazy professor teaching a class (the audience) how to go on a date and basically succeed in love.

Well done and thanks for a great time director Kate and dramaturge Phil and actors Isaac, Amy, Jack, Lily, Michael and Haylee.
