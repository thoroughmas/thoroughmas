Trailers are excellent because they can make no sense. This is why I made one for my YouTube channel.

That's right, my <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/Thoroughmas">Thoroughmas YouTube channel</a>, where the cardboard set is wobbling in the background while the <strike>actors</strike> <strike>actor</strike> <strike>presenter</strike> slave stutters over his illogical lines about something entirely meaningless. But hey, it's all for good natured fun! Well, mostly good natured fun... occasionally I use violence against stuffed toys to tackle real post-modern social issues.

You can watch the new trailer right here:
