Despite a slew of dreadful technical issues (including poor performance from both Skype and Google Hangouts - possibly due to the <i>peccable</i> Australian internet), I've just published the first episode of a new game show style podcast! It's a wacky idea that starts very basic in this first episode, but that I hope to build on in the future! Hope you enjoy it!
