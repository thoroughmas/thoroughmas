That's a lie, of course. Rather, I made short films for Danny Elfman's music.

Two of them. It was for a competition held on indi.com earlier this year. The brief: simply make a short film with a piece from Danny Elfman's wonderful ballet score, *Rabbit & Rogue*, as the soundtrack. Elfman is obviously one of my favourite composers of all time, so this was an opportunity I couldn't pass by.

The two films I made were quite a challenge to produce. They were both shot over about a week, in Darwin's unpredictable wet season, with many first-time actors and an absolutely bone-thin skeleton crew. In order to make production achievable I decided not to record sound on set. So every single sound you hear in both of these films, every piece of dialogue, every footstep, was added in post. It's quite funny to think that just about everything you hear was either composed by Danny Elfman or recorded in my bedroom.

The first is a fast-paced fantasy-comedy-adventure about a boy who summons an imaginary friend.

And the second is a strange little story about someone who cannot see the real world.
