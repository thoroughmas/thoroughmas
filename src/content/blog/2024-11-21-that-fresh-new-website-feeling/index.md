Smells pretty good right?

Actually yeah, don't sniff too hard. Knowing how I've thrown it together, it's probably got errant links that take you directly to my bank account or something.

I've had many personal websites over the years. Making them is something that I've always been interested in and only mildly good at.

Some of the earliest ones I can remember I built with Freewebs. Which later changed its name to Webs, and later [shut down completely, apparently deleting everything](https://www.reddit.com/r/DataHoarder/comments/l2jzib/webscom_aka_freewebscom_deleting_tens_of_millions/).

My early websites featured my projects under the moniker "Lcm Film".

Here's one of the final forms of that Freewebs site (which went through a ridiculous number of regenerations... every few months it was "Let's remake the website!").

Not much as changed, has it? Get rid of the dated Google+ link and the ear-searingly bright background, and this website could pretty much do the trick for me today. Actually, I wish I'd had that thought a couple days ago...

It's even got a "Brand New Website!" blurb there, just like the one I'm writing right now.

But if you look closely, my favourite bit is the little "What's going on!?" image on the left, with a link to go back to the previous version of the website. How thoughtful!

My websites were actually much more fancy back then. I mean, each of those menu links lights up when you hover over them. And the Library has links to separate pages for each short film I was hosting. Yes, actually hosting. Videos weren't all just hosted on YouTube back then, like they are now (for better and (lately) worse).

This is what it looked like when I was just starting to get into minimalism.

Now I was using my own name, a picture of myself, and starting to base everything about my YouTube Channel. Exciting times.

Later on I had this site. Which again, in hindsight I'm pretty impressed by, and I wonder why I got rid of it. It's pretty elegant for 2016.

I can't take all the credit for this one though. It was created with help from my mate [Drew Collins](http://drewcollins.me/). Who was and I have to assume absolutely still is an absolute legend.

For a little while I had a website that looked like this. Holey moley. We all go through design phases.

Since then and in-between I've had various other sites, hosted with Blogger, Squarespace, Wordpress, Drupal, and I think at one point in my teens I lost my mind and went pure CSS.

Then the website I've had for the last few years has been a very basic Wordpress page.

I was determined to go proper minimal with this one. No icons, only a few lines of text, one image.

And I think it has served me well.

But I have been wanting for something a little more robust. A little cleaner. A little better at communicating everything I'm up to. And with a blog built in, so that I can write *stuff like this*!

Which brings me to the new website.

First up was choosing a platform. I don't like Wordpress, it's a clunky mess to me.

I wanted something that was

- open source
- modern and widely-used
- affordable (or free)
- and highly customisable

It didn't take long to discover that there are more great options out there than ever.

I could use something like Publii. It's got everything I want, and even has an easy to use GUI. But after trying it for a little while, I quickly realised that unless there was a template that I really liked, it was going to be frustrating to customise.

So I started looking at others: Ghost, Hugo, Zola, Eleventy. So many good options!

But ultimately, it came down to the availability of templates. Even though I intend to customise a lot, I want a very solid base.

And so this new website is built on Astro. Which ticks all the right boxes and appears to be very popular.

Plus, I really love this template by Muhammad Syakirurohman. It's clean and elegant, putting projects and blog posts at the forefront. And since it's built on Astro, the potential for customisation is unending.

It's also a great boon that platforms like Astro integrate beautifully with markdown files. I've been using Obsidian a lot over the past year for extensive note-taking, and being able to write blog posts the same way is very intuitive.

The tricky part is, of course, learning Astro.

Code is something I've always dabbled in but never really become proficient. So it's only with the help of Claude and ChatGPT that I've been able to stuck into designing this website.

But as helpful as AI bots are for getting started on something you don't understand, it sucks to rely on them too much for too long. After a while, you want to ditch the training wheels and fly on your own, you know.

So that's the journey I have ahead of me! And that's what makes it fun! Sure, I could fork out however much money each month for Squarespace and have a great website in minutes (or so all the podcast ads tell me). But I wouldn't feel like I am *truly* the master of the website. This way, as long as I don't absolutely crash and burn, nothing is holding me back. 

For me, one of the key themes of 2024 has been not getting locked in. Not getting locked into a bad habit, a particular way of thinking, or a digital app or service.

So that's it, that's my new site, and this has been the first blog post.

With the internet becoming *even more* fragmented all the time, it's wonderful to have my own independent space to bring together everything that relates to me.

And hey, if you do find a link to my bank account... eh, you're welcome to whatever's there.
