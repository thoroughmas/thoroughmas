Probably, it's relatively easy. But despite the question-posing headline I just (mis)used, I don't actually want you do say Sketch Files. I'd rather that you watched:

<div style="text-align: center;">
<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PIG8CYd3mlQ" width="560"></iframe>
</div>

Thanks to everyone who helped me make this without knowing what it was. You're so gullible but in a good way.
