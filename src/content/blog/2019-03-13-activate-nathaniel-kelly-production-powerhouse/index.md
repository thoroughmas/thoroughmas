In the past couple weeks my long-time filmmaking collaborator, Nathaniel Kelly, has started (or rather, returned to) producing short and simple YouTube videos. He has made two of these new ones so far, and both were entirely shot and edited in the same afternoon. They're fairly simple and straightfoward, but that doesn't make them any less interesting and cool. And with both of us working on larger projects lately, it's always nice to remind yourself what you can create in a single afternoon.

Here are the two flicks! First one featuring yours truly.
