I'm always keen to experiment with videos that are a bit unlike any I've ever made before, and this one certainly applies. It's all modern, hip and trendy because I play a game in it and you see me on webcam and stuff, but it's also a completely fake spoof.

Also it features Star Wars: The Old Republic which is actually for real one of my favourite games. Not necessarily because it's good, but it's an MMO and it's Star Wars and that's my perfect equation.

Have a watch:

Remember that you can subscribe to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCj0TxJVIPfIrC_8w_tz02Uw" target="_blank">my YouTube channel</a> if you want to encourage me to go further into weird video madness. Anything could happen.
