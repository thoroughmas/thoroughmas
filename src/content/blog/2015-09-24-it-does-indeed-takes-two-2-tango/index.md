It was an honour to be sound recordist, 1st assistant director and a side character in Nathaniel Kelly's latest film, <i>It Takes Two To Tango</i>. It's a wacky comedy and feel-good high school lark, mockumentary style. At nearly 40 minutes in length and created with less than a shoestring, this was a stellar effort by Kelly and all the lovely people who dedicated some of their time to the project.

And the movie is now up <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku-1S1Hntzs" target="_blank">on YouTube</a> for all to consume. There's also <a href="http://natkellyfilms.com/it2tt/" target="_blank">a snazzy webpage all about the film over here</a>!
