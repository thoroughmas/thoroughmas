Hi! Or as Batman would say, "WHERE IS SHE!?"

Even though he's one of the most mainstream entities around at the moment, I can't help but love Hans Zimmer's film scores. They're often grand and powerful and make you want to be a pirate or operate a heist in someone's subconscious.

Anyway, the recent trilogy of Batman Begins, The Dark Knight and The Dark Knight Rises by Christopher Nolan contained some top-notch Zimmer. I decided to make a list of my five favourite tracks from the three scores.
