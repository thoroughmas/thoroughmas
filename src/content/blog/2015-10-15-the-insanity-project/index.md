I'm ecstatic to have finally completed a film I've been dragging through production for a fair few months now. <i>The Insanity Project</i> is a long short thriller set and shot in Darwin, featuring all the local talent I could get my hands on during the busy month of July. It's a strange creation, but aren't they all?
