For the sixth year in a row, I've created a list of my favourite soundtrack music of the year. This year I present my **24** top original scores released in the year 2024.

The video above presents this list with short clips from each score, but below you can find my list in written form.

Debian for servers, as its an easy extension of the Debian I learned when tinkering with Chromebooks.


Unraid


Respect for Linux Mint and Zorin and Solus, which I tried a few times over the years but as clean is it was, its inner workings always felt foreign and mysterious to me. When something broke, my brain broke with it.

And it really is cool to have so many options

All in all, Fedora has become the "it just works and I enjoy using it" operating system for me. Which is quite unexpected... until this year it always sounded like one of those dangerous complicated operating systems that only bold programmers would ever use. But right now, it may not be the most warm, inviting, reliable and supportive operating system I've ever used... but it's close. And when you consider its huge range of features and customisability, its simply a winner.

It turns out, this really was the year of the Linux desktop. For me, anyway. And with the [Steam Machine launching in a few months](https://store.steampowered.com/hardware)... maybe 2026 could be it for some other people too!
