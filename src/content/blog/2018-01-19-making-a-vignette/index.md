"Vignette" is an experimental (well I mean, they're all experimental aren't they?) short film I've been working on, which introduces ideas I'd love to expand into a much larger work down the track. I suppose it's a fantasy/adventure/drama concept. Involves a group of girls who fight demons, I mean why not?

I've been thinking about these ideas for a few years now. It's wonderful to see it become something tangible. Here's a little demonstration of the progression from my sketches to the real life actors!

I expect to share this wacky short film next month.
