Fake things.

This is a 30 second commercial I made with Drew Collins (<a href="http://drewcollins.me/" target="_blank">lovely fellow, check out his website</a>) for an invented product - Hannigan's Mouthguard. Drew did all the visual effects which are amazing because he's a REAL LIFE REGULAR MODERN DAY WIZARD.
