Over the past few days I've made my first couple of video game-themed videos. One's a song and one is a monologue. Both are intended to be humorous but are based on truths. And both are here for your viewing pleasure:

The first one is based on my first experiences in the Closed Beta of Sony Online Entertainment's new building MMO, <i>Landmark</i>. It really is a game that requires you to put on your creative hat.

Second is in regards to a game I have spent a lot of time in, EA BioWare's <i>Star Wars: The Old Republic</i>. The game has many contentious issues, but it's still a bunch of fun, which I explore a little in this light-hearted song.</div>
