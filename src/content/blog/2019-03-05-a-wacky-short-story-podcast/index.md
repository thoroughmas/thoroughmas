Years ago, my mate Christopher Stennett started writing a short story every single week, and publishing them on his website <a href="http://waitwhatsorry.com/">waitwhatsorry.com</a>. These stories are very wacky and diverse and pretty unpredictable. And at this point, there are hundreds of them.

As an enormous fan of podcasts and audiobooks, I of course began to wonder if I could audio-ify them. Chris has accepted, Thomas Field has done up a jingle, and so every Monday I will be releasing an audio version of a story from <i>Wait! What? Sorry.</i>

Check out the first episode here:
