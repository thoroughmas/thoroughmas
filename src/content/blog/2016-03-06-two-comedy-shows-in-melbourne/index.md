I am writing to inform you that during this month of March in the year of our Lord 2016 I will be performing in two comedy plays in Melbourne.

The first is a short play in Moreland Theatre Company's "Two Pairs of Shorts" at The Butterfly Club. [Here's the event on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/events/550279448473010/permalink/554814968019458/). I play a pretty dim guy stuck in the boot of a car. It's a bit'a fun, written and directed by Matt O'Reilly and Silvi Vann-Wall.

Second comes a play by Brendan Black of [Bon Voyage Productions](http://www.bonvoyageproductions.com/). "Trotsky and Friends" is an original comedy set in a Café in Austria in 1913. It stars an ensemble of lovable misfits featuring Freud, Lenin and Stalin. I play the unfortunate waiter of this Café. And again, I'm dim. Why would you want to see me any other way? Anyway, this show's a part of the Melbourne Internationall Comedy Festival this year, and [more details are over on the Facebook event page](https://www.facebook.com/events/1146724122013067/).
