I've had a fair bit of fun making the short film Conductor of Earth, and since it won't be publicly viewable for a while yet I decided to follow in the footsteps of George Lucas and Peter Jackson, and do a prequel. And that prequel is called Miracle Man.

*Miracle Man* introduces *Conductor of Earth*'s titular character, Aidan, and explores some of the activities he got up to before the film.

It's available both as an eBook and an Audio Drama (read by some *very* cool people). [Jump over to the project page to get it now](http://thomasmidena.me/film/miracle-man)!

Hope you enjoy! And huge thanks to everyone who helped make it!
