Doctor Who, with all its stellar highs and cringeworthy lows, is my favourite TV show. As we head towards the beginning of the 10th season of the show this weekend, a made this video to renew my excitement. In the video I attempt to demonstrate just how pervasively recurring the show's themes of perseverence and optimism are. It's my belief that if you boiled the whole thing down, all it's action and style and adventures and monsters, those are the key elements you'd have: perseverence and optimism.  Part video essay and part salivating fan montage, here's the video:

&nbsp;Like many things in life, if I had known how much time and effort it would take to make this video I probably wouldn't have done it, but I'm glad I did.
