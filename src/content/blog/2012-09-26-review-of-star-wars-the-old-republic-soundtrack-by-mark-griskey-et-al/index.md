I recently wrote a review for a soundtrack which (spoilers) I love - Star Wars: The Old Republic. It's a huge soundtrack which has so much to offer any fan of Star Wars or orchestral music in general. [Check out my review over at Tracksounds](http://tracksounds.com/reviews/star_wars_old_republic_mark_griskey.htm).

Underneath the review you can also see my star ratings for individual tracks.

Do you love the Star Wars: The Old Republic score as much as me? Let me know!

Yours optimistically,
Thoroughmas
