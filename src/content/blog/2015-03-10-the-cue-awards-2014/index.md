This year I joined the fantastic team at Tracksounds again for the Cue Awards - a recognition of our favourite film, TV and video game scores from the past year. Most agree that 2014 was an abnormally excellent year for soundtracks, which made this year's Cue Awards more hotly contested and ergo a lot of fun.

You can find the big <a href="http://blog.tracksounds.com/2015/03/soundcast-ep-80-2014-cue-awards.html" target="_blank">Cue Awards episode of Tracksounds' Soundcast podcast over here</a>. It's a pretty long show but well worth it, a fair few winning composers came on to accept their awards. I'm often struck by how humble composers come across. I suppose they're a rather underappreciated bunch in general, especially for the heavy lifting they do in the crafting of engaging entertainment.

These are good times for original score fans.
