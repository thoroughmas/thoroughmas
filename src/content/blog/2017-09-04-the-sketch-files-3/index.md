A few years ago I made a short film comprised of a series of unconnected quirky skits and called it The Sketch Files. Last year I made a second one. And now here is the third!

The Sketch Files 3 continues the series by doing what every stereotypical sequel must: it's bigger, longer, darker and more complicated. Even more than the previous instalments this one really is a collection of pretty wildly contrasting scenes. I think of it as Key &amp; Peele meets Twin Peaks, with the punchy genre-bending farce of the former and the slow, abstract absurdity of the latter. But made in Darwin, and by me of course.

Thanks to the many(!) people who helped out on this one. It was a lot of fun and kept me well amused and I hope you find it interesting.
