I have a few fairly wacky short films in postproduction right now, and my casts have bullied me into making trailers for them since I'm taking so long to finish the edit. Here are the results.

Case: Fluff is a spoof on the murder mystery, drawing inspiration from AMC's The Killing and HBO's True Detective.

Then there's Marco, a fairly straight suspense horror.

Both should turn out pretty interestingly. The final cuts will be online by the end of the year.

Yours darkly,

Thoroughmas
