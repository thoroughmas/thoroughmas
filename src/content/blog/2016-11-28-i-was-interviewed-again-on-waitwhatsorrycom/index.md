Well the title says it all, really. My good friend continues to run his legit blog called <a data-cke-saved-href="https://waitwhatsorry.com/" href="https://waitwhatsorry.com/">*Wait! What? Sorry.*</a>, where he did <a data-cke-saved-href="https://waitwhatsorry.com/2014/11/11/who-is-that-guy/" href="https://waitwhatsorry.com/2014/11/11/who-is-that-guy/">a fun interview with me a few years ago</a>. Well he's interested in all this Conductor of Earth stuff I'm working on, so he interviewed me again a couple of weeks ago. <a data-cke-saved-href="https://waitwhatsorry.com/2016/11/22/is-this-an-interview/" href="https://waitwhatsorry.com/2016/11/22/is-this-an-interview/">The result is now up and available for your reading pleasure&nbsp;on his website</a>.

Speaking of Conductor of Earth (and lately, when am I not?), there's some cool new stuff coming this week.
