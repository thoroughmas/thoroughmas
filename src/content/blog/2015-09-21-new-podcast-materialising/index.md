Yes, I have started a few podcasts within the past few weeks. Now I just have to make sure they don't all die after one episode!

This latest one is a Doctor Who discussion podcast, which I've just started to coincide with the 9th Season of the show premiering. Doctor Who is a show that I love tremendously and often hate vehemently, and therefore it should be a good topic for some weekly TV conversation!

Here's our Episode #1.
