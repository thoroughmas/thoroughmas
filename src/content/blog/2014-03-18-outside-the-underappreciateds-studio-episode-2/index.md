It was over a year ago that I made a little comedy audio sketch called Outside The Underappreciated's Studio. And it is only now that I am releasing the second episode of the series!

It's on Soundcloud. Yay! Everyone likes Soundcloud these days!

Be warned: many silly voices roam uncontrolled.

There's also a third episode on the way soon, and it makes me laugh a lot.

Until then,
Yours prominently,
