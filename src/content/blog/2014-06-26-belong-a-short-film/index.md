At la universidad I was given the assignment of creating a short film under the crazy-low length of 90 seconds. At this length the challenge becomes finding a nice balance between making a short with one basic scene, and making something with a true narrative arc.

Well, mine is complete now, and here it is for you to witness. It's about trying to fit in and "Belong", but it's not necessarily optimistic about this universal human desire.

I should warn you, I decided to try some trippy constant-panning which has made some people not only perch on the edge of their seats - but also fall off their chairs. Strap in.
