The new season of Doctor Who has begun, and so returneth the Doctor Who recap podcast A Bad Case of Loving Who.

On this first episode I'm joined by regular co-host Chris to talk about the latest episode and some general issues surrounding the show. Listen below, or <a href="http://www.thomasmidena.me/podcast/a-bad-case-of-loving-who">find out more about the podcast and all of its previous episodes over here</a>.

It should be a fun season, and we'll likely be having a few guests dropping in along the way. Geronimo etc!
