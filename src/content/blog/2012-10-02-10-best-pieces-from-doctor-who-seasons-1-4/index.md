Murray Gold is one of my favourite film and television composers. Over the past seven years he's created tons and tons (and tons) of fantastic music for Doctor Who. Recently I fell into a ridiculous pit of insanity and recklessly thought I'd list my favourite 10 tracks from Doctor Who Seasons 1 through 4 (the Christopher Eccleston and David Tennant eras). This was a terrible idea which was utterly impossible. So here it is.

Enjoy.
