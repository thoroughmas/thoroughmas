Another year of The Cue Awards is officially finished! For those that aren't aware, The Cue Awards is an annual celebration of the best in original music for films, television and video games. It's run by&nbsp;<a href="http://tracksounds.com/">Tracksounds</a>, and the nominations are decided by the Tracksounds team (of which I am a part).</div>

There are certainly a few big names that didn't make it, but the final nominations (and winners) are undoubtedly worthy. And as always there are a few titles that have been under-appreciated by general audiences, and The Cue Awards is an excellent way to give them a little limelight!</div>
