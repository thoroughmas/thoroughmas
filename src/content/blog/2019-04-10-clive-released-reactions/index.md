Last week, Nathaniel Kelly's new web series, CLIVE, was unleashed on YouTube. It's a colourful little series with six short, digestible episodes.

In today's day and age, something doesn't exist unless there's a reaction video. So in conjunction with the release of CLIVE, I produced a reaction video for each episode, with a range of people from the cast &amp; crew. They start weird and get weirder and weirder.

I'm glad we live in a world where CLIVE exists.
