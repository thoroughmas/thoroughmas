The final episode of this little series is now live.

This episode has a slightly different kind of flavour, since it was edited by the excellent [Nat Kelly](http://www.youtube.com/user/abirdstudio). Oh, and I act in it a little bit.

Some behind-the-scenes videos will be uploaded soon, which are sure to be rather amusing.

Yours doggedly,
